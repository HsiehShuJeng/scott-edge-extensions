# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a Pull Request creation tool to the "Asking Expert" browser extension. The tool will allow users to input a title and description for a pull request and generate a command that can be executed locally to create the PR using git commands. This enhances the extension's programming assistance capabilities by streamlining the PR creation workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want to input PR title and description text, so that I can generate a formatted pull request creation command.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the extension popup THEN the system SHALL display a new PR creation section separate from existing commit tools
2. WHEN the user views the PR section THEN the system SHALL show a textarea for inputting PR title and description
3. WHEN the user types in the textarea THEN the system SHALL accept multi-line text input with proper formatting
4. IF the textarea is empty THEN the system SHALL show appropriate placeholder text guiding the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to click a button to generate the PR command, so that I can quickly copy and execute it locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the PR generation button THEN the system SHALL generate a printf command with the textarea content
2. WHEN the command is generated THEN the system SHALL automatically copy it to the clipboard using pbcopy
3. WHEN the command includes the PR text THEN the system SHALL properly escape special characters and quotes
4. WHEN the command is generated THEN the system SHALL extract git repository information (owner, repo, current branch, base branch)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the PR tool interface to be visually consistent and user-friendly, so that it integrates seamlessly with the existing extension design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views the PR section THEN the system SHALL display it in a separate container from commit tools
2. WHEN the user interacts with the PR section THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling colors and themes matching the commit-tools container
3. WHEN the textarea is displayed THEN the system SHALL use similar styling attributes as the Korean word textarea (input-control class, proper sizing)
4. WHEN the button is displayed THEN the system SHALL follow the same visual design patterns as existing commit-btn buttons

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling for the PR tool, so that I receive clear feedback when something goes wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF git repository information cannot be extracted THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
2. IF the clipboard copy operation fails THEN the system SHALL notify the user of the failure
3. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL not break the existing extension functionality
4. WHEN the user provides invalid input THEN the system SHALL provide helpful guidance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the generated command to be ready for immediate execution on my local machine, so that I can paste and run it directly in my terminal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the command is generated THEN the system SHALL format it as a complete printf command with proper shell escaping
2. WHEN the command includes repository details THEN the system SHALL extract owner and repo from git remote origin URL using sed commands
3. WHEN the command includes branch information THEN the system SHALL use git symbolic-ref for current branch and git remote show for base branch
4. WHEN the command is copied to clipboard THEN the user SHALL be able to paste and execute it directly in their terminal without modification
5. WHEN the command is executed THEN the system SHALL output formatted text that can be used with PR creation tools and copy it to clipboard via pbcopy
