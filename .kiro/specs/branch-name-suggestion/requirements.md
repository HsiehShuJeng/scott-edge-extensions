# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a branch name suggestion tool to the "Asking Expert" browser extension. The tool will allow users to input a feature description or bug report and generate a prompt that can be copied to clipboard for use with AI assistants to brainstorm appropriate branch names. This enhances the extension's programming assistance capabilities by helping developers create meaningful and consistent branch names.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want to input a feature description or bug report, so that I can get a prompt as input for a LLM model.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the extension popup THEN the system SHALL display a branch name suggestion section separate from existing tools
2. WHEN the user views the branch suggestion section THEN the system SHALL show a textarea for inputting feature requirements or bug descriptions
3. WHEN the user types in the textarea THEN the system SHALL accept multi-line text input
4. IF the textarea is empty THEN the system SHALL show placeholder text like "Feature to implement or bug to fix"

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to click a button to generate a branch naming prompt, so that I can quickly copy it and use it with AI assistants for brainstorming.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the branch suggestion button THEN the system SHALL generate a formatted prompt string
2. WHEN the prompt is generated THEN the system SHALL automatically copy it to the clipboard
3. WHEN the prompt is created THEN the system SHALL include the user's input text followed by the specific prompt template
4. WHEN the prompt template is used THEN the system SHALL format it as: "${user_text}\n\nBased on the above requirement(s), please suggest branch names for brainstorming and references. As development effort will be made based on the requirement."

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the branch suggestion tool interface to be visually consistent and user-friendly, so that it integrates seamlessly with the existing extension design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views the branch suggestion section THEN the system SHALL display it in a separate container from other tools
2. WHEN the user interacts with the section THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling colors and themes matching existing tool containers
3. WHEN the textarea is displayed THEN the system SHALL use similar styling attributes as other textareas (input-control class, proper sizing)
4. WHEN the button is displayed THEN the system SHALL follow the same visual design patterns as existing buttons

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling for the branch suggestion tool, so that I receive clear feedback when something goes wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF the clipboard copy operation fails THEN the system SHALL notify the user of the failure
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL not break the existing extension functionality
3. WHEN the user provides no input THEN the system SHALL provide helpful guidance or prevent action
4. WHEN prompt generation succeeds THEN the system SHALL display a success notification

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the generated prompt to be ready for immediate use with AI assistants, so that I can paste it directly and get relevant branch name suggestions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the prompt is generated THEN the system SHALL format it as plain text ready for AI assistant input
2. WHEN the prompt includes user requirements THEN the system SHALL preserve the original formatting and line breaks
3. WHEN the prompt is copied to clipboard THEN the user SHALL be able to paste it directly into any AI assistant interface
4. WHEN the prompt template is applied THEN the system SHALL provide clear context about the purpose (branch naming for development)
