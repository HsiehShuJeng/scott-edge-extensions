# Learning

1. Every time a commit is made, README.md and lesson_learned.md must be checked and updated if needed.
    - All diagrams in README.md (component diagram, extraction logic flowchart, component architecture diagram) must be reviewed and updated if the architecture, data flow, or supported scenarios change.
    - The scenario table in README.md must be updated if new scenarios are added or existing ones are changed.
    - Any new diagram must be added to README.md (ask for permission if needed).
    - The Table of Contents, scenario documentation, and contributor onboarding sections in README.md should be kept in sync with the codebase and workflow.
    - Regarding lesson_learned.md, all implementation or conceptual changes should be noted.

2. Regarding diagrams defined by Mermaid:
    - Always double quote the text if there are special characters (e.g., brackets, angle brackets, etc.) to ensure compatibility.
