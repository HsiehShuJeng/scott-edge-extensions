# Lessons Learned: Implementing Commit Message Generation

## Functional Overview
This extension assists language learners (English and Korean) by generating optimized LLM prompts for vocabulary, and programmers by generating commit messages:
- Single word analysis
- Word with context sentence
- Multiple words with context

## Technical Implementation
1. **DOM Manipulation**: Added event listeners to new UI elements using `querySelectorAll` and `addEventListener`
2. **Clipboard API**: Used `navigator.clipboard.writeText` for reliable text copying
3. **Command Generation**: Implemented template literals for complex command strings with proper escaping
4. **Modular Design**: Integrated new functionality with existing notification system
5. **Error Handling**: Maintained consistent error handling patterns

## Design Considerations
1. **User Experience**: 
   - Clear visual feedback through notifications
   - Consistent styling with existing UI elements
   - Intuitive button labeling
   - Added theme toggle for improved readability in different lighting conditions
2. **Maintainability**:
   - Centralized command generation logic
   - Separation of concerns between UI setup and business logic
   - Reuse of existing utility functions
   - Persisted user preferences using chrome.storage API

## Best Practices
1. **Extension Architecture**:
   - Followed Chrome extension messaging patterns
   - Maintained separation between popup and background scripts
   - Used ES6 modules for code organization
2. **Code Quality**:
   - Consistent code style with existing project
   - Proper error handling for clipboard operations
   - Descriptive variable and function names

## Potential Improvements
1. **Command Validation**: Add validation for git repository presence before showing buttons
2. **Customization**: Allow users to modify commit message templates
3. **Accessibility**: Enhance button accessibility with ARIA attributes
4. **Internationalization**: Support multiple languages for UI elements

## General Insights
1. **Chrome Extension Development**:
   - Popup scripts have limited execution time
   - Clipboard access requires user interaction (button clicks)
   - Notifications are essential for user feedback
2. **Git Integration**:
   - Different diff commands serve different purposes
   - Proper escaping is crucial for command templates
   - The 50/72 rule improves commit message readability
3. **Project Workflow**:
   - Incremental changes with tool-based validation are effective
   - Maintaining existing patterns reduces integration issues
   - Clear separation of concerns simplifies future enhancements
