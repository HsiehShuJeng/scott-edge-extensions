# Lessons Learned: Robust Vocabulary.com Extension Implementation

## 1. Scenario Separation for User Experience
- **Manual Entry Always Works:**  
  The popup logic ensures that if the "Word" field has content, "Generate Prompt" will always generate and copy the prompt, regardless of page parsing. This prevents the extension from being blocked by parsing failures.
- **Page Parsing as Fallback:**  
  Only if the "Word" field is empty does the extension attempt to parse the active tab for a word and sentence, making the UX robust and user-friendly.

## 2. Enhanced Programming Tools Architecture
- **Modular Tool Design:**  
  Separated commit message generation, PR creation, and branch naming into distinct but cohesive tools within the same interface.
- **Input Validation Strategy:**  
  Implemented comprehensive validation for all programming tools with specific character limits and clear error messaging.
- **Enhanced Conventional Commit Integration:**  
  Built comprehensive conventional commit rules directly into the extension, providing structured guidance for consistent commit messaging.

## 3. Auto-Resize and UX Improvements
- **Dynamic Textarea Sizing:**  
  Implemented auto-resize functionality with a 300px maximum height to improve content visibility while maintaining popup constraints.
- **Theme-Aware Notifications:**  
  Enhanced notification system that adapts to light/dark themes using CSS variables for consistent user experience.
- **Accessibility Enhancements:**  
  Added proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support across all interactive elements.
